## Working with the submodule

Note this project uses a git submodule to manage translations. That repository is [here](https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-localization)

```bash
# init submodules when running for the first time
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```bash
# run this when you need to update the submodule
$ git submodule update
```

If you have more issues with submodules, please check out [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-frontend/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Environment and Firebase Setup

These steps will allow you to set up your application environment and database to be able to develop on the findadoc project.
We use firebase for both data storage and authentication, and you can set up an account for free to have your own sandbox.

1. Copy the below file to have the configuation values that you'll fill in in the next steps:

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

2. Setup a free-tier account on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). If you have an existing account, proceed to 2.
3. Create new project with a unique name for your local findadoc development.
4. Create an application (Go to project > Settings (gear icon) > My Apps > Create a new Web app). You won't need to set up analytics.
5. In your new application, go to Firestore and create a database.
6. Set permissions to allow script access the database from the Firestore console. Change false in the below to true.
```
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```
7. Fill in the keys found in your firebase console into the `.env` file you created. An example would look like the below (these are example values):
```
FIREBASE_API_KEY="Your API Key"
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-dev-app.firebaseapp.com"
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="https://your-dev-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-dev-app"
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-dev-app.appspot.com"
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="625586025312"
FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:625586025312:web:bb04b01ccb5ad69b223558"
```
8. Run the script to populate your database with example entries, like this:
```bash
node scripts/setup_firebase.js
```
9. Checking your firestore should now show collections populated for `clinics`, and other databases used by the application.
9. Turn on Authentication for your project in Firebase, and add yourself as a user, setting a password. This will allow you to log in to the admin panel in the project.
10. VoilÃ . You can now continue to build and locally run your project. See below for how to build.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Internationalization (i18n)

Under the hood, this project uses [nuxt/i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) and [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/).

The locale files are managed through a separate repo, incorporated as a submodule. Here is the process for adding new translation keys:

1. Clone the [findadoc-localization repo](https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-localization)
2. Edit the `locales/en.json` to contain the new keys.
3. If you know another language, feel free to add the same key and translation to the appropriate locale file. Omit if you don't know it; we use English as the [fallback language](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/fallback.html) so nothing will break.
4. Make a pull request to the localization repo and wait for it to be merged to `main`
5. Update the submodule (see above) to get the latest keys
6. Make your change in this repo with the new i18n keys and submit your PR ðŸŽ‰
